## Arbitrage Script
- Basic Arbitrage script written in javascript and using the ethers.js library. This code will run locally and make calls to the polygon network. The script searches +10 DEX's to find the best exchange results. Since script supports 2 paths for all exchanges there are literally hundreds of thousands of different routes that a token can take. The best time for arbitraging is during market volatility.
